application like gmail:

  little bar at top: message sent...if you send a message.. this is a one time message time feedback...  other types of messages ie 'you bought this melon' 'you rented this movie'


  from flask import Flask

   @app.route('/color-submit') 
   def submit-color()

   flash ('color saved') 

   gives feedback to the user after an action happened... IE if user pressed submit, you'll see a feedback... the flash fun. python - end of things

   flask itself.. doesn't change html or do this...

   on the base.html... the code i put notes on
      with: how you assign variable... if it was js you would of use var name = ...

      if messages... are there any messages? is it empty? if empty go to end of the if statement..or if there is a message, loop over each message in messages, each time after the message you push out that message via <li>

      Why is this in the base templet:  it'll appear at the top and appear everywhere...built in for flash...

      *****one time message use flash('color saved'); 1x feedback...

      **** works for cookies... it won't continue to show the message.. that the magic of using the flash('color saved').. it won't show up again.
